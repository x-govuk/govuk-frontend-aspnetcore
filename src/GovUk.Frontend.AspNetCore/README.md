# ASP.NET Core integration for GOV.UK Design System

This library simplifies setting up an ASP.NET Core application to use the [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/).
It includes tag helpers to produce GDS components which integrate with ASP.NET Core's model binding system.

See the [full documentation](https://github.com/x-govuk/govuk-frontend-aspnetcore/blob/main/README.md) for installation and usage guides.
